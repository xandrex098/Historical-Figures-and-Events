    <p>
        The EDSA People Power Revolution was a historic four-day uprising in February 1986 that led to the peaceful overthrow of the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos.
        This revolution was the result of decades of corruption, human rights violations, and political repression. The assassination of opposition leader 
        <strong>Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino Jr.</strong> in 1983 was a turning point that sparked mass protests, leading to widespread calls for democracy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Marcos ruled the Philippines for 21 years, declaring <strong>Martial Law in 1972</strong>, which granted him absolute power. His regime was marked by censorship, suppression of
        dissent, and a deteriorating economy due to corruption. The opposition, led by <strong>Corazon "Cory" Aquino</strong> (widow of Ninoy Aquino), gained massive public support.
        When Marcos called for <strong>snap elections in 1986</strong>, widespread fraud led to mass protests, culminating in the EDSA Revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over <strong>two million Filipinos</strong> gathered along <strong>Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA)</strong> in Metro Manila, forming human barricades, praying, and peacefully
        protesting. Soldiers and tanks sent by Marcos refused to attack civilians, and on <strong>February 25, 1986, Marcos fled to Hawaii</strong>, marking the triumph of the people.

                    Senator <strong>Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino Jr.</strong> was one of the fiercest critics of President <strong>Ferdinand Marcos</strong>. 
                    After three years of self-imposed exile in the United States, Aquino decided to return to the Philippines despite warnings of danger. 
                    As he disembarked from <strong>China Airlines Flight 811</strong> at <strong>Manila International Airport</strong> 
                    (now <strong>Ninoy Aquino International Airport</strong>), he was assassinated on the tarmac.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The official government report blamed the assassination on a lone gunman, <strong>Rolando Galman</strong>, but many believed it was 
                    a state-ordered execution. The public outcry was immediate, with millions mourning Aquino‚Äôs death and calling for an end to the 
                    Marcos dictatorship. His funeral procession on <strong>August 31, 1983</strong>, lasted over <strong>11 hours</strong> and was attended 
                    by <strong>over 2 million people</strong>, marking one of the largest demonstrations against Marcos at the time.

                <p>
                    On <strong>November 3, 1985</strong>, during an interview on the American television program <strong>"This Week with David Brinkley"</strong>, 
                    President <strong>Ferdinand Marcos</strong> unexpectedly announced that he would hold a <strong>snap presidential election</strong> in early 1986, 
                    a year ahead of schedule. The move was seen as an attempt to prove his legitimacy and silence growing opposition, especially after increasing 
                    international pressure and domestic unrest following the assassination of <strong>Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino Jr.</strong> in 1983.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The decision came as a surprise to many, including Marcos' own political allies. It was widely believed that U.S. President <strong>Ronald Reagan</strong>, 
                    a long-time supporter of Marcos, had advised him to seek a fresh mandate to counter allegations of dictatorship and fraud. The snap election, however, 
                    would prove to be a critical moment that led to the downfall of the Marcos regime, as it triggered massive protests and exposed widespread election fraud.

                <p>
                    On <strong>February 7, 1986</strong>, the highly anticipated <strong>snap elections</strong> took place between 
                    <strong>President Ferdinand Marcos</strong> and opposition leader <strong>Corazon "Cory" Aquino</strong>. 
                    The election was marked by widespread reports of <strong>voter intimidation, ballot tampering, and fraud</strong>, 
                    leading to accusations that Marcos was manipulating the results to stay in power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As ballots were counted, conflicting results emerged. The <strong>Commission on Elections (COMELEC)</strong>, 
                    controlled by Marcos, declared him the winner, while the independent <strong>National Citizens' Movement for Free Elections (NAMFREL)</strong> 
                    showed <strong>Aquino leading</strong>. International observers, including the <strong>United States and the Catholic Church</strong>, 
                    condemned the elections as fraudulent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In response to the fraud, <strong>computer technicians from COMELEC walked out</strong> in protest, publicly exposing election rigging. 
                    This event further fueled national outrage, leading to mass protests and setting the stage for the <strong>EDSA People Power Revolution</strong>.

                <p>
                    On <strong>February 22, 1986</strong>, tensions within the Philippine military reached a breaking point when 
                    <strong>Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile</strong> and <strong>General Fidel Ramos</strong> publicly broke away from the Marcos regime. 
                    They, along with the <strong>Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM)</strong>‚Äîa group of reformist officers‚Äîhad originally planned a coup against 
                    <strong>President Ferdinand Marcos</strong>. However, their plans were discovered, forcing them to abandon the coup and instead take refuge 
                    in <strong>Camp Aguinaldo</strong> before moving to <strong>Camp Crame</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Realizing the urgency of the situation, <strong>Jaime Cardinal Sin</strong>, the influential Archbishop of Manila, used <strong>Radio Veritas</strong> 
                    to call on the Filipino people to support the defectors. In response, thousands of civilians, including priests, nuns, and ordinary citizens, 
                    gathered along <strong>EDSA</strong>, forming a human barricade around the military camps. They brought food, flowers, and rosaries, turning what could 
                    have been a violent standoff into a peaceful demonstration of unity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the crowds grew, military support for Marcos began to crumble. Several key military commanders defected, refusing to follow orders to attack <strong>Camp Crame</strong>. 
                    The situation escalated when Marcos attempted to deploy tanks and heavily armed soldiers, but civilians blocked their path, kneeling in prayer and pleading for peace. 
                    Some soldiers, moved by the people‚Äôs resolve, abandoned their posts and joined the uprising.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This momentous event marked the beginning of the <strong>EDSA People Power Revolution</strong>, a four-day movement that would ultimately lead to the downfall of Marcos. 
                    Overwhelmed by the mass civilian resistance and the loss of military support, Marcos was forced to flee the country on <strong>February 25, 1986</strong>, 
                    ending his two-decade rule.

                <p>
                    By <strong>February 23, 1986</strong>, the streets of <strong>Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA)</strong> were filled with over <strong>two million Filipinos</strong> 
                    from all walks of life‚Äîordinary citizens, priests, nuns, students, professionals, and activists‚Äîgathering in peaceful protest against the 
                    Marcos regime. Carrying rosaries, flowers, and banners, they demanded an end to dictatorship and the recognition of <strong>Corazon "Cory" Aquino</strong> 
                    as the rightful leader.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the protest grew, <strong>Marcos ordered troops and tanks</strong> to disperse the crowd and attack <strong>Camp Crame</strong>, where 
                    the defecting military officers, led by <strong>Juan Ponce Enrile</strong> and <strong>Fidel Ramos</strong>, had taken their stand. 
                    However, in a powerful act of nonviolent resistance, the people linked arms, knelt before the advancing tanks, and prayed. Many soldiers, 
                    moved by the courage of the protesters, <strong>refused to open fire</strong> and instead defected, joining the revolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On <strong>February 24</strong>, Marcos, still clinging to power, attempted to declare a <strong>state of emergency</strong> and called for 
                    reinforcements. However, the defection of key military leaders, including <strong>General Artemio Tadiar</strong> and 
                    <strong>Major General Renato de Villa</strong>, left him with dwindling support. International pressure, especially from the 
                    <strong>United States</strong>, also played a significant role in isolating Marcos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, on <strong>February 25, 1986</strong>, two historic inaugurations took place: <strong>Corazon Aquino</strong> was sworn in as the 
                    new President at Club Filipino, while <strong>Marcos held his own oath-taking ceremony</strong> at Malaca√±ang Palace. However, by nightfall, 
                    realizing he had lost control, Marcos and his family were forced to flee to <strong>Hawaii</strong> with U.S. assistance, marking the 
                    end of his <strong>two-decade rule</strong> and the victory of the <strong>People Power Revolution</strong>.

                    On <strong>February 25, 1986</strong>, the Philippines witnessed the culmination of the <strong>People Power Revolution</strong>. 
                    As protests surged and military defections continued, it became clear that <strong>Ferdinand Marcos</strong> could no longer maintain his grip on power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That morning, two separate presidential inaugurations took place. <strong>Corazon "Cory" Aquino</strong>, the opposition leader, was sworn in 
                    as the legitimate President of the Philippines at <strong>Club Filipino</strong> in San Juan, surrounded by thousands of supporters. Meanwhile, 
                    in a desperate attempt to cling to power, Marcos held his own inauguration at <strong>Malaca√±ang Palace</strong>, attended by a small group of 
                    loyal followers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the situation quickly deteriorated for Marcos. His remaining allies, including his defense chief, had either <strong>defected</strong> or 
                    advised him to step down. The U.S. government, under President <strong>Ronald Reagan</strong>, also withdrew its support, urging Marcos to leave 
                    peacefully to avoid bloodshed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As night fell, Marcos and his family were escorted by U.S. helicopters to <strong>Clark Air Base</strong> in Pampanga before boarding a U.S. 
                    Air Force plane bound for <strong>Hawaii</strong>. This marked the end of his <strong>21-year rule</strong> and the triumph of the Filipino people's 
                    call for democracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The departure of Marcos was met with celebration across the nation. Filipinos flooded the streets, cheering, crying, and embracing one another. 
                    The dictatorship had fallen, and the Philippines had entered a new era of democracy and hope.
